## Welcome to the ds4real project:  Data Science for Real Estate and the built environment

This is an open source project with the intention of creating a ```bookdown``` in R that focuses on modeling the built environment using the R statistical language.  I welcome any contributions you may have, as this will be an ongoing project that collects knowledge about solving built environment problems with a data science approach.

For now, everything will be collected in the [book](https://github.com/EconGeo/ds4real/tree/book) branch of the project.
